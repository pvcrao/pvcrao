### 🧠 What I’m focusing on:
- 🔧 Infrastructure as Code using **Terraform**
- 🌀 CI/CD pipelines with **Azure Devops & GitHub Actions**
- ☁️ Cloud provisioning on **Azure** – VMs, VNet, Storta, IAM
- 🐳 Containerization using **Docker**
- ☸️ Orchestration with **Kubernetes AKS & EKS & Kubeadm**
- 📦 Automating deployments using **Ansible & Bash scripting**
